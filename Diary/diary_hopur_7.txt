Me (Guðni) and Riko met up at our huuuge table, and we got to know each other. We started working on the class diagram, the use cases and the requirement list. 
We also set up a simple github repo.
Our  main task was simply to get our head around the project at hand.

Started the day by having a short meeting of todays task:
- Working on the figma design and the flow of the system
- Continue work on the happy paths
- Finishing the use cases

The big theme of the day ended up being the set up of the voyages:
We had a long talk about how we want to have the "Create Voyage" part flow better, than having to menu diving back and forth. 
We wanted to streamline that proccess. We jumped some ideas around. 
Generally we weren't sure how the process of creating a voyage should go, if the user should be able to create flights from the create voyage part, or if that shold be its own thing.

Sindri and Manwin worked hard on the creating the wireframe in figma, for us to see how thhe program would function, and from what 
Gestur and Manwin also worked on the happy paths for every requirement.
Riko finished million the use cases!!

Today was the biiiiiiggest day so far, we added in the missing sections, being a text about the class diagrams and some conclusion text.
We formatted the text so it looked cohesive.
We noticed some things that could be improved in the class diagrams, so we fixed that before we put it back in to our report.
Finally we handed in our report!

Day started out by us putting together the skeleton of the project. Created the folders for the logic, data, models and ui, as well as the corresponding wrappers.
We had the TA's comingi over to review the feedback we got on the design report, and we had the non-functional requirements missing as well as the UX requirements, so tomorrow will go into making those!

We also made a list all employee funcationality just to see if our skeleton worked, which it does!
