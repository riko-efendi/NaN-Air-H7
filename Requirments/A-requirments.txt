USER INTERFACE; 
Ascii art when appropriate 
all data should be laid out in a way that is appealing to the eye
from every frame there should be functions that allow the user to go back one page and also restart the program
if the program is restarted the data already registered should not be deleted but rather saved
when all voyages have been created we should be able to give out a list of all off and on duty employees
color scheme?
