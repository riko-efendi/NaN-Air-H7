[git HANDBOOK]

Welcome to the git handbook, here I will provide all the rules of our git eco system!
The system we are currently using, is that each member has their own assigned branch, and works on their tasks there.
To prevent us from doing the same things, we'll have to assign ourselves distinct tasks.

[Codebase]
We are heavily following the example from the pre-recorded lecture, about the setup of the project.
So it's important that you watch or atleast have a general understanding of how the three layered design set up works.
You can find the example project at: "Verklegt námskeið 1/Modules/example_project.zip

[Rules]
1. Do NOT push to main, without letting anyone know, unless you're making a diary/git handbbok entry.
2. Always write a descriptive commit message.
2. Don't merge your branch to main, without letting anyonen know.
3. Don't push to other peoples branches, without letting them know.

Most important rule: If you are unsure about anything, don't be afraid to ask. There are no dumb questions.
